        <div class="text1 text"></div> <p>Most will remember hearing every single one of these songs at least twice per day and they got old abnormally quick. The Billie Eilish songs on this list are probably the best in overall production and aren't so repetitive. Also, to this day I do not know why Old Town Road was so popular...</p>

      <div class="text2 text"></div><p>These bops definitely helped people dance and tiktok their way through quarantine. Exremely overplayed special mentions include Circles and Dance Monkey. Trampoline and Godzilla are among the very few fine crafted songs on this list that aren't just four chords and dumb lyrics. </p>

      <div class="text3 text"></div><p>Right now, the billboard is all over the place, but that's not necessarily bad. We have a healthy mix of teenage angst, annoying rap-pop, overplayed hits, more teenage angst and of course, the occassional country song that has "cold beer" somewhere in the title.  </p>
